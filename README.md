To run this notebook, I mounted on [Google Colab] using my Google Drive account. The notebook is designed to be executed in the Google Colab environment by using Python libraries.

Libraries:
- google.colab
- OpenCV cv2
- Any required libraries (numpy)

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository:

   Clone this repository to local machine and directly upload the PennAerialRobots.ipynb notebook to a Google Colab environment.

2. Open in Google Colab:

   - Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Upload the `PennAerialRobots.ipynb` notebook from the repository.
   - Upload the PennAir2024AppStatic.png and PennAir2024AppDynamic.mp4 and PennAir2024AppDynamicHard.mp4 to Google Drive

3. Mount Google Drive:

   The notebook requires access to Google Drive to load datasets or other files. Run the first cell to mount Google Drive.

4. Run the Notebook:

   Execute the code cells sequentially. Make sure all necessary files and data are correctly loaded from  Google Drive.

5. Evaluate Outputs:

   - Check the output of each cell.
   - Compare with expected outcomes as mentioned in the Penn Air Software Challenge pdf file.


Note: This Google Colab notebook has the code written for Parts 1, 2, and 3. However, the code for part 3 is still a work in progress and currently does not produce the expected outcome for PennAir2024DynamicHard.mp4 video.
